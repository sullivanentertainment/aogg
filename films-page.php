Conceived in the mind of famous Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery over a century ago, Anne of Green Gables continues to capture the hearts and minds of people around the world.

The first of the films, &#8216;Anne of Green Gables&#8217; was originally developed as a TV mini-series, showing on CBC, PBS and The Disney Channel in 1985. In 1987, Producer and Director Kevin Sullivan reunited much of the original case and created &#8216;Anne of Avonlea&#8217;, based loosely on Montgomery&#8217;s sequel novels: Anne of Avonlea, Anne of the Island and Anne of Windy Poplars.

The third instalment, &#8216;Anne of Green Gables: the Continuing Story&#8217; was created in 1998. This completely original story, penned by Sullivan, aimed to bring Anne into a time frame and story line that had been developed over the 91 episodes of spin off series, &#8216;Road to Avonlea&#8217;.

In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the publication of Montgomery&#8217;s original novel, the final film &#8216;Anne of Green Gables: A New Beginning&#8217;, was both a prequel and sequel to the original series, released in 2009.

This is the enchanting sequel to the Emmy Award-winning ‘Anne of Green Gables’, in which Anne Shirley makes the transition from a romantic, impetuous orphan to an outspoken, adventurous and accomplished young teacher.

After the wedding of her best friend, Diana Barry, and a proposal from Gilbert, Anne decides to leave Avonlea to accept a teaching post at Kingsport Ladies College. In order to succeed, Anne must win over the icy Katherine Brooke and endure tormenting from the snobby Pringle family. Anne finds a kindred spirit in Emmeline Harris, who is being raised by her cranky grandmother, Margaret Harris, and wants nothing more than to be loved by her absent father, Morgan Harris. Anne and Emmeline become fast friends, and Anne quickly forces her way into the Harris family and ultimately changes their lives.

However, after a chance encounter with Gilbert, Anne begins to re-evaluate what is important to her. A surprise question from Morgan Harris makes Anne realize how much she misses home. Upon her return to Avonlea, she learns news about Gilbert and must decide how much he truly means to her.

Canadian actress Megan Follows returns to her role as Anne. Tony Award-winner Colleen Dewhurst stars opposite her as aging Marilla Cuthbert and Oscar-winning actress Dame Wendy Hiller appears as the prickly dowager Mrs Harris. A stirring and charming follow-up, to the epic tale of the beguiling red-head.

Now in her twenties, Anne returns to Avonlea for the first time since Marilla Cuthbert’s death. Gilbert has been offered a position in a hospital in New York, and he persuades Anne to come with him. He arranges a position for her at a large publishing house.

After many unsuccessful months, Anne and Gilbert move back to Avonlea and into the middle of wartime society. Gilbert feels pressure to join the army as a medical officer, and is soon listed as missing in action.

It is 1945 and Anne Shirley, now a successful, middle-aged writer, has returned to Prince Edward Island for an extended visit. On a whim, she agrees to write a play for a theater producer. The play, she reasons, will keep her busy – at least busy enough to not go out of her mind with worry about her only son who has yet to return from the war overseas.

But a long-hidden secret in the form of a letter from her errant father, discovered under the floorboards at Green Gables, provides a distraction of its own.

	</div>
	<div class="grid__item col-sm-6">
		
As Anne struggles to complete the play, she delves into long-buried memories, reliving the troubled years before she arrived as an orphan at the Green Gables farmhouse. She is forced to confront the fact that she made up stories about her life; after her mother died when her father deserted his young daughter.

&nbsp;

During that time, Young Anne, is taken into the care of a wealthy matriarch, Amelia Thomas and her daughter-in-law, Louisa, which changes her life forever. Over the course of one remarkable summer, Anne Shirley discovers the astonishing truth about her father, the origins of her quest for “kindred spirits” and the roots of her brilliant, magical imagination.
